### Intro

Iâ€™m passionate about the intersection of data science and product development. Part of my work involves writing and coding.

**Coding**
For development, I use Sublime, Visual Studio Code and Notebooks. I mostly code in Python and have been really impressed with the interactive data modeling tools in iPython lately. Once you try the iPython notebook you won't go back.


**Math and Algorithms And Notes:** 

I use typora, which is a lovely app for writing in markdown format. 
I also do math. The math is mostly analog, on paper or whiteboard. I sketch most of my ideas out that way. 


### Chair 
Finally i use a Herman Miller Replica chair, which offers excellent lumbar support, adjustable height, and a comfortable seating position for extended periods of use. 


### Misc 
Current mobile device: iPhone 16 Pro Max  
Fitness: Apple watch SE 



**Notes:** 
- Dropbox
- Overleaf 
- Markdown with Typora
- Notebooks (yes)

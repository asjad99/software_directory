### MultiMedia Setup 
 
 - Desktop: My Current build includes a ASUS motherboard  powered by a 12th Gen Intel® Core™ i5-12600KF processor with 16 cores, allowing me to handle multiple tasks efficiently. Also equipped with 64.0 GiB of memory, providing ample space to run multiple applications simultaneously. My graphics are powered by  NVIDIA [GeForce RTX 3070 Ti] graphics card, which enable high-quality visuals for graphic-intensive applications such as gaming or video editing. My casing is designed to be quiet, ensuring that I operate smoothly and without any distracting noise.


### Software: 


**Notes:** 
- Dropbox
- Overleaf 
- Markdown with Typora
- Notebooks (yes) 


**Coding**
For development, I use Sublime, Visual Studio Code and Notebooks. I mostly code in Python and have been really impressed with the interactive data modeling tools in iPython lately. Once you try the iPython notebook you won't go back.


### Math and Algorithms And Notes: 

I use typora, which is a lovely app for writing in markdown format. 
I also do math. The math is mostly analog, on paper or whiteboard. I sketch most of my ideas out that way. 


### Chair 
Finally i use a Herman Miller Replica chair, which offers excellent lumbar support, adjustable height, and a comfortable seating position for extended periods of use. 


### Misc 
Current mobile device: iPhone XS with 
Fitness: Apple watch SE

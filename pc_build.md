**Coding:** For development, I use Sublime, Visual Studio Code and Notebooks. I mostly code in Python and have been really impressed with the interactive data modeling tools in iPython lately.

**Math and Algorithms And Notes:**  I use typora, which is a lovely app for writing in markdown format. 
I also do math. The math is mostly analog, on paper or whiteboard. I sketch most of my ideas out that way. 

**Misc**:
Current mobile device: iPhone 16 Pro Max  
Fitness: Apple watch SE 

**Notes:** 
- Dropbox
- Overleaf 
- Markdown with Typora
- Notebooks

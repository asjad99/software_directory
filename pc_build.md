Part of my work involves writing and coding,.   

I use typora, which is a lovely app for writing in markdown format. 

I also do math. The math is mostly analog, on paper or whiteboard. I sketch most of my ideas out that way.  


For development, I use Sublime, Visual Studio Code and Notebooks. 

I mostly code in Python and have been really impressed with the interactive data modeling tools in iPython lately. Once you try the iPython notebook you won't go back.

#### Desktop PC Build 

My Current build includes a ASUS motherboard  powered by a 12th Gen Intel® Core™ i5-12600KF processor with 16 cores, allowing me to handle multiple tasks efficiently. TAlso equipped with 64.0 GiB of memory, providing ample space to run multiple applications simultaneously.

My graphics are powered by  NVIDIA [GeForce RTX 3070 Ti] graphics card, which enable high-quality visuals for graphic-intensive applications such as gaming or video editing. My casing is designed to be quiet, ensuring that I operate smoothly and without any distracting noise.

System is powered by Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS. My input devices include a Logitech G402 mouse and a Keychron K7 keyboard, which provides precise control and a comfortable typing experience.

Finally i use a Herman Miller Replica chair, which offers excellent lumbar support, adjustable height, and a comfortable seating position for extended periods of use.

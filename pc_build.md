Part of my work involves writing and coding,.   

I use typora, which is a lovely app for writing in markdown format. 

I also do math. The math is mostly analog, on paper or whiteboard. I sketch most of my ideas out that way.  


For development, I use Sublime, Visual Studio Code and Notebooks. 

I mostly code in Python and have been really impressed with the interactive data modeling tools in iPython lately. Once you try the iPython notebook you won't go back.
